AffectRecognitionFromBodyGestures
=================================

This project is my Bachelors Major project. It is a research oriented Gesture recognition project using OpenCV and svm. 


To run the project:

Ensure that a camera is connected to your system. 
Run the Segmentation.cpp file.
Enter 'B' for the image you want to be the background. 
Then while sitting in front of the camera enter 'C'.
